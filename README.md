# DA_CODE_QUIZ_TIME_WEEK4
Creating a JavaScript Quiz with a Timer and High Score. 

JavaScript Quiz Time!

In this weeks homework project we had to create a quiz using concepts we have learned in class.
This homework was a great challenge, it helped me solidify some concepts in JavaScript and also 
helped understand the importance of thinking as a deloper. I continue to see the importance of pseudocoding
and beign able to work on parts of the project which helped me tacke some initial challenges I was having with timer and adding
questions. One important concept I learned in this homework was hoisting, I struggled a bit with declarations but managed 
to get a better grasp in understanding them. 

Attached is a view of the JavaScript Quiz with questions and timer countdown.
